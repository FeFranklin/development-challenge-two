<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="center">
  <img width="500" height="500" src="https://imgur.com/nmebLXv.jpeg" alt="patient register app">
</div>

The project is a development challenge of MedCloudBr. A patient register UI with CRUD operations. Firstly, I built the fronted as I imagined it would be easy to use.
Simple TextFields and a button to register the patient. After that, I felt the need to show the user the operation was successfull which made me add some notifications
components. All the components created and implemented use MaterialUI as foundation. The larger components and operations are split for better readability.

The project was interesting to build because
* Implement and add features as the UI is composed based on the needs
* Fun to play around MaterialUI components and improve them
* Writing CRUD operations as efficient as possible

### Built With

Tech stack used in this project:

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/)
